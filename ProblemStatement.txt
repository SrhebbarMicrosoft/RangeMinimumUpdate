Given an array A of size N, there are two types of queries on this array.
1. qlr: In this query you need to print the minimum in the sub-array A[l:r].
2. uxy: In this query you need to update A[x]=y.
Input:
First line of the test case contains two integers, N and Q, size of array A and number of queries.
Second line contains N space separated integers, elements of A.
Next Q lines contain one of the two queries.

Output:
For each type 1 query, print the minimum element in the sub-array A[l:r].

Contraints:
1=N,Q,y=105
 1=l,r,x=N
